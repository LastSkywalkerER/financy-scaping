# Theory

## Introduction

This set of theoretical materials will be useful for both beginners and Node.js developers with some basic level of knowledge in databases and ORMs and experience in using them. Feel free to skip some topics if you are familiar with them. Once you finish this course you will:

- get strong understanding of difference between SQL and NoSQL databases
- get knowledge in SQL basics, using PostgreSql db
- learn fundamentals of Redis and Mongo db
- and how to get your application connected to them with native Node.js tools and ORMs like Sequalize, Mongoose and Redis client
